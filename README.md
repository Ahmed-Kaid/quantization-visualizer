# Quantization Visualizer

[ðŸ‡©ðŸ‡ª Deutsche Version](https://github.com/Ahmed-Kaid/quantization-visualizer/blob/main/README.de.md)

A simple interactive website to visualize the quantization technique used in JPEG compression.

## Requirements

- NodeJS (https://nodejs.org/)

- A modern web browser
  (Chrome â‰¥ 60, Firefox â‰¥ 60, Edge â‰¥ 15.15063, iOS â‰¥ 10, Safari â‰¥ 10, Android â‰¥ 6)

## Download

To download this project, use one of the following steps:

- Clone this repository `git clone https://github.com/Ahmed-Kaid/quantization-visualizer.git`
- Download the [latest Release](https://github.com/Ahmed-Kaid/quantization-visualizer/releases/latest/download/quantization-visualizer.zip) and extract it to a folder
- Download the repository as ZIP and extract it to a folder

## Usage

After downloading, run `npm install` in the root directory to install all dependencies.

To open up the site with everything working as intended (ðŸ¤ž), run `npm start` in the root directory.
